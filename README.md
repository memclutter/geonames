# geonames

My scripts, parser and tools for working with the geonames free Gazetteer data source. 

Data source http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/

# Motivation

Many projects need a list of countries. There is also a need for pre-filtering data, for example, to select only countries with a population of more than 10m or countries of Europe.

Also, different projects require different formats, for example `json`, `sql` and `xml`.

The goal of this project is to create a number of scripts to generate such lists of countries.

I hope someone will like it. I also hope someone writes recommendations and feature requests.
